# Real-time-supply-chain-monitoring-system
In this Project we are developing a real-time supply chain monitoring device which can provide supply managers and clients with live
data about temperature, humidity and location of the product being
supplied, mitigating any problems along the chain before they arise.
This project enables remote accessing and monitoring of the status
of the product in between supply chains and can be checked for any
faults in the supply chain by the live data provided. Internet of Things
(IoT) concept is being used to design and develop the project and We
are using an IoT-cloud database service to receive and organize all
the sensory live data sent from the edge layer after, as this data from
the edge layer is raw, we used some data extraction algorithms to extract necessary data for sake of less transmission cost and less latency.
This real time data from the cloud database would be further interfaced
virtually through a telegram chatbot which make uses of data extraction algorithms from json files from the cloud database server APIs.
This project assumes to full fills the need of a low cost, compact, real
time monitoring system. In a supply chain, the status of the product remains hidden and mostly human dependent, where this project
comes in handy. This can be made use in industries like pharmaceutical, chemical and food industries etc. This project would further help
in decision making, validating the stock, delivering delicates etc
